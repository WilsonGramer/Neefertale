# Neefertale
The greatest Undertale hack. Ever.

### For contributors:
* Make sure that you _don't_ rename any of the files. These files were named what they are so that Undertale can recognize them and apply the Neefertale mod.
* _DO NOT_ add or remove any lines in any of the text files under /code. Doing so will shift every other piece of code in the game over by 1 (or more), and will make the game unplayable (like it will immediately crash).
* Stick to the same pattern as is already instituted in /code/neefertale.txt, and only modify certain words and common themes in the game (names, deter~~mination~~gent, etc). Try not to rewrite an whole line of dialog in the game.
* Hey. Don't download this unless you have actually bought a legitimate copy of Undertale. I only added in the EXE so that my non-tech-savvy friends can just click on it and everything's there. :) Plus, Undertale's a really cool game anyway!

### Other extremely important things
Yay and yay and also yay.
