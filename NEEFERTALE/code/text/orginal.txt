\E3* The queen is a lot&  different from&  ASGORE.../
\E7* She actually checks to&  see if I'm doing&  anything./
\E0* She's really turned&  this whole place&  around!/
\E3* Oh^1!&* Hey^1!&* Wait a second!/

SPECIALK
\E0* the queen returned^1, and&  attempted to resume&  ruling the underground./
* she enstated a new&  policy.../
\E3* all the humans who fall&  here would be treated&  not as enemies.../
\E3* .../
\E1* but people REALLY&  didn't like that&  policy./
\E0* because of you^1, not&  only was the king&  gone.../
\E3* but the human souls&  had gone missing as&  well.../
* along with the lives&  of countless citizens./
* along with the life&  of.../
* along with the life&  of undyne^1, their&  greatest hero./
* nobody wanted to see&  that happen ever again./
\E0* so the people started&  a rebellion to&  overthrow the queen./
\E2* but^1, she^1, uh^1, pretty&  much gave up peacefully&  when she realized./
\E1* so she went back&  to the ruins./
\E0* the underground's&  basically an uneasy&  anarchy now./
\E0* everyone's trying to&  live life like they&  always have.../
\E3* but it's not really&  easy^1, you know?/
* when all of your&  hope has pretty much&  been thrown away.../%%
\E1* undyne spearheaded&  the revolution^1, of&  course./
\E3* she was pretty mad&  after what happened&  to asgore./
\E3* she was pretty mad&  after what happened&  to asgore and alphys./
\E1* she threw the queen&  out of the castle&  with her strength./
\E0* then she became the&  empress of the&  underground.../
* and banished the&  queen back to the&  ruins./
\E1* seems like undyne's..^1.&* hmmm.../
\E3* even more vehement&  about destroying&  humanity than ASGORE./
\E1* .../%%
\E2* but hey^1!&* it's not all bad!/
\E0* she's not so lonely&  anymore./
\E1* me and papyrus go&  and visit her.../
\E0* we bring her books&  from the library^1,&  or play games.../
\E2* we've even convinced&  her to leave&  sometimes./
\E1* as long as me or&  papyrus stay behind&  to watch for humans./
\E2* but papyrus loves&  doing that./
YEAH!!^1!&I LOVE STANDING IN&FOR THE QUEEN!!!/
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING&FOR WHEN A HUMAN&COMES./
I'M GOING TO BE&A GREAT MOM!!!/
\E3BY THE WAY^1,&WHO ARE YOU&TALKING TO?/
OH, COOL^1.&TELL THEM I SAY&HI!!!/
* papyrus says hi./
\E0* well^1, i hope things&  are better where&  you are./
\E2* later./%%
\E1* when the queen went&  back to the ruins.../
\E2* i decided to go&  with her./
\E1* and i took out some&  books from the&  library^1, too./
\E1* so she won't have&  to read the same&  ones./
\E0* she's a good roomie^1.&* we have a lot of&  fun./
\E1* you know./
\E1* sometimes the queen&  talks about.../
\E0* how she'd like to&  see you again./
\E1* isn't that nice?/
\E3* i don't have the&  heart to tell her&  what you did./
\E0* do you know how she'd&  react?/
\E3* if i told her that&  'cause she protected&  you.../
\E4* ... you went on to&  kill my brother...?/
\E1* anyway^1, never come&  back here./
\E0* you are not welcome./
* since you left^1,&  things down here.../
\E3* are different./
* with ASGORE gone.../
\E0* undyne became the&  ruler of the&  underground./
\E3* she's decided to&  destroy every human&  that comes here./
\E3* and since the human&  souls disappeared.../
\E0* she's also looking&  for a new way to&  break the barrier.../
* and when she does^1,&  she's going to wage&  war on humanity./
\E1* i mean^1, that was&  asgore's plan^1, too./
\E2* but he was really^1,&  uh^1, bad at it./
\E0* undyne has also&  expanded the royal&  guard massively./
* she says the first&  thing she'll do after&  we get out of here.../
* is take her army.../
\E3* and personally hunt&  you down and destroy&  you./
\E1* meanwhile.../
* i've been knocking&  on the door to&  the RUINs.../
\E3* but the woman that's&  there hasn't been&  answering me./
\E1* maybe she's not&  feeling well?/
\E3* heh./

\E4* you'd better watch&  yourself^1, kid./
\E4* things are lookin&  real bad for you./%%

\E3* so.^1.&* it's been a while./

\E3* people were heart-&  broken. everyone they&  looked up to.../
* everything they were&  relying on^1, in one&  night, disappeared./
* everyone clamored to&  elect a new ruler as&  fast as possible./

\E2* papyrus became the&  ruler?/
\E1* why doesn't he talk&  to you about this.../
\E0HELLO!!^1!&HUMAN!!!/
\E3IT'S STRANGE./
\E3ASGORE^1, ALPHYS^1,&METTATON^1, AND&UNDYNE WENT AWAY./
\E0SANS SAYS THEY&WENT ON VACATION./
I HOPE THEY'RE&HAVING FUN!!!/
\E3OH YEAH./
\E0I'M THE RULER OF&THE UNDERGROUND&NOW!!!/
EVERYTHING IS&IMPROVING A LOT&HERE./
PRODUCTIVITY IS UP!/
BECAUSE I TELL&EVERYONE TO KEEP&WORKING./

\E3WE'VE DECIDED^1, UM./

\E2* we can't judge&  humans to be all&  good or all bad./

\E6YOU KNOW.../
DON'T TELL MY&BROTHER, BUT.../
DESPITE THE&IMPROVEMENTS&WE'VE MADE.../

\E0WE'LL GET OUT&OF HERE^1, SLOWLY!!!/
THEN WE CAN ALL&HANG OUT AGAIN!!!/
\E0NYEH HEH HEH!!!/%%
\E3* it's been a while^1,&  huh?/
* things have gotten&  pretty bad here./
\E0* everyone considered a&  leader disappeared&  overnight./
\E1* it's gotten so quiet./
\E3* there's a bad feeling&  hanging over&  everyone./
* like everyone's just&  going to die here^1,&  trapped in the dark.../
\E2* ... i bet you're&  wondering why i'm&  not the ruler./
\E1* eh./
\E1* i'm not cut out&  for something like&  that./
\E2* i like to take it&  easy^1, you know?/
\E3* ... that's a joke./
\E3* this is what happens&  when people like me&  take it easy./
\E4* see ya./%%
\E0* hey^1, at least things&  are less crowded./
\E1* 'cause of all the&  people you killed./
\E2* hope that was a good&  experience for you./
\E2* just kidding^1.&* i don't really hope&  that./
\E4* go to hell./%%
\E1* it seems a number of&  important people&  disappeared overnight./
* but no one else was&  harmed./
\E0* the people were&  confused^1.&* it was complete bedlam./
\E3* somehow^1, at the end of&  the day.../
\E1* a small^1, white dog&  became president of&  the underground./
\E0* it sleeps on the&  throne and does&  absolutely nothing./
\E1* strangely^1, it seems&  this is the best&  life for everyone./
\E2* thanks./%%
\E1* i'll be honest./
\E2* i have no idea what&  happened for you&  to get here./
\E1* this is actually some&  sort of error-&  handling message./
\E3* so^1, if you're getting&  this ending.../
\E1* tell whoever made the&  game^1, okay?/
\E2* they'll fix it^1, or&  if it's a novel&  situation.../
\E1* they might even add&  another ending to&  the game./
\E3* chances are^1, though.../
\E4* you're just a dirty&  hacker^1, aren't you?/
\E1* yeah^1, get outta here./%%
\E1* H..^1. hey./
\E0* So..^1. you're the one&  who killed all my&  friends./
\E1* I just called to tell&  you./
\E0* I hate you./
\E1* Yet..^1. strangely..^1.&* It's because of you^1,&  that.../
\E2* That I was forced to&  become a better&  person./
\E0* When I first saw you&  hurting people.../
* I just sat there^1.&* Watching you./
\E1* I felt so guilty knowing&  I hadn't do anything&  to stop you./
\E3* I felt like all I&  do was.../
\E4* Was hope you would&  destroy me^1, too./
\E1* But when Undyne called^1,&  with crazed desperation&  in her voice.../
\E0* I..^1.&* I realized I had to do&  something./
\E1* Even if it meant&  everybody would.../
* Have to learn the&  truth about me./
\E2* It's strange^1.&* You know?/
\E5* Even after all the&  bad things I did./
* People treated me like&  a hero./
\E2* And then they..^1.&* Asked me to run&  everything./
\E5* So I'm trying my&  best^1, here./
\E2* I think I have some&  good policies^1, but^1,&  y-you know.../
\E1* Talking to people&  still makes me&  nervous./
\E0* I'm no ASGORE^1,&  you know?/
\E4* God..^1.&* I miss everyone./
\E3* Now that they're&  gone^1, it.../
* It feels so clear what&  I should have done./
\E3* What I should have&  said./
\E6* Undyne..^1.&* Asgore.../
* Mettaton.../
\E5* At least Sans is&  still here./
\E4* He's..^1.&* He's a good guy^1.&* And with him around.../
\E4* I.../
\E2* Sigh./

Why did you let me go? /
\E7Don't you realize that&being nice.../
\E1... just makes you&get hurt?/
\E0Look at yourself./
\E9You made all these&great friends.../
\E0But now^1, you'll probably&never see them again./
\E9Not to mention how&much they've been&set back by you./
\E6Hurts^1, doesn't it?/
\E7If you had just gone&through without caring&about anyone.../
\E6You wouldn't have to&feel bad now./
\E0So I don't get it./
\E7If you really did&everything the right&way../
\E0Why did things still&end up like this?/
\E6Why...?/
\E5Is life really&that unfair?/
\E9.../
\E0Say./
\E9What if I told you.../
\E0I knew some way&to get you a better&ending?/
\E9You'll have to load&your SAVE file, and.../
\E9You'll have to&start over^1, and.../
\E0Well, in the meantime^1,&why don't you go see&Dr. Alphys?/
\E0Well^1, in the meantime^1,&why don't you go see&Undyne?/
\E0Well^1, in the meantime^1,&why don't you go see&Papyrus^1, then Undyne?/
\E9It seems like you&could have been&better friends./
Who knows..^1. maybe&she's got the key&to your happiness...?/
\E4See you soon./%%
But^1, despite everything^1,&your happy ending&didn't come./
\E5Why...?/
\E4I know why./
\E4Go to Dr. Alphys./
\E5Your date with her&has really just&begun./%%
So you went the&whole way through&without killing.../
\E5And then you decided&to kill ASGORE?/
\E6What the hell is&WRONG with you?/
\E4You COMPLETELY missed&the point./
\E2Are you trolling me?/
\E0Because./
\E4No./
\E5You are only&trolling yourself./
\E6What a waste of&everybody's time./
\E7All you had to&do was make friends./
With Papyrus^1, Undyne^1,&and then Alphys./
\E2But you were too&busy messing it up!/%%
Hey./
Since you defeated me./
I've been thinking./
\E3Is killing things&really necessary?/
\E1I.../
\E3I honestly don't&know anymore./
\E0I have a request&for you./
\E4Prove to me.../
\E5Prove to me you&are strong enough&to survive./
\E6Get here from&the beginning./
\E0Without killing a&single thing.../
\E4... and I won't&kill the king./
\E4... and^1, maybe.../
\E7Then you'll have&your so-called&"happy ending."/
\E6So^1, what will&it be?/
\E5Will you prove&yourself?/
\E8Or will I get to&watch you suffer...?/
Either way^1, I'm&interested!!!/
\E4Hee hee hee.../%%
Interesting.../
\E6So^1, even with&everything you did.../
\E5The outcome's still&the same./
\E9In the end^1, your&choices were an&illusion./
\E9NOTHING you do&really matters!/
\E8Hee hee hee!/
\E8.../
\E0Well./
\E6You DID do what&I told you./
\E5I guess it's up&to me to get you a&REAL happy ending./
\E0For starters^1, you&can't do it by&yourself./
Papyrus^1, Undyne^1,&Alphys..^1. these guys./
\E4Are you friends with&all of them yet?/
\E5Maybe you should go&back and..^1. "hang"&with them./
\E4The power of&friendship.../
That always saves&the day^1, right?/%%
\E0So^1, killing people&is ACTUALLY fine...?/
\E4Sure./
I'm glad we agree on&the value of a life./
I've learned SO&MUCH from you./
\E0Though..^1. are you&REALLY gonna keep&doing things halfway?/
\E8The amount of people&you killed.../
\E9It's honestly&DISAPPOINTING./
\E8You IDIOT./
\E4You really can't do&ANYTHING right./%%
Why^1, 
...?/

\E1WHY?/
\E8We were on our way&to REAL victory.../

\E9Is this REVENGE?/
\E1Making me watch you&act so pure and&happy^1, while I...?/

\E1.../
\E7No./
\E8NO./

\E4Well^1, I'll let you&mess around./
\E8I know you'll come&back eventually./

\E9You really DON'T&get it^1, do you?/
\E5There's only one&person I could care&about anymore./
\E6And even then^1, I&couldn't TRULY care&about them./

\E4Quit looking at me&with that stupid&expression./
You're pissing me&off./%%
\E0So you're here&again./
\E2What's wrong with&you?/
\E4Are you trying to&start the Flowey&Fan Club?/

\E4You'll have to&talk to Papyrus./
\E6Yeah^1, he started&one./
\E5A few different&times^1, anyway./
\E0I won't lie./
\E4He's one of the&better characters&to mess around with./
\E5Took me a long&time to get bored&of that one./

\E4Talk to him&about it./%%

\E4Did you start the&Flowey Fan Club?/
\E5Ha^1.&I'm just kidding./
\E9I was watching^1.&I know you didn't./

\E6He probably would&have invited his&garbage brother./
\E4You know^1.&Smiley Trashbag./
\E4Say./
If I have ONE piece&of advice for you.../
\E9DON'T./
Let his brother./
Find out ANYTHING&about you./
\E6He'll..^1. well.../
\E5Let's just say./
\E9He's caused me more&than my fair share&of resets./
\E4Stay away from&that guy./%%
\E0Why do you keep&coming back here?/
You don't REALLY&want to be friends^1,&do you...?/
\E4No^1. I get it./
You're just like me^1,&aren't you?/
You don't care about&anyone./
\E4You're just bored./
You just want to&see what I'll say./
\E5So you can laugh&and throw me away&like a broken toy./
\E8Well^1, TOO BAD!/
\E9I'm not LIKE everybody&else./
\E9So, from now on.../
\E4You're not getting&ANYTHING./%%
\E4Don't you have&anything BETTER to do?/%%

I remember the day&after my son&died./
The entire underground&was devoid of hope./
The future had once&again been taken&from us by the&humans./
In a fit of anger,&I declared war./
I said that I would&destroy any human&that came here./
I would use their&souls to become&godlike.../
... and free us from&this terrible prison./
Then, I would destroy&humanity.../
And let monsters rule&the surface, in peace./
Soon, the people's&hopes returned./
My wife, however,&became disgusted with&my actions./
She left this place,&never to be seen&again./%%
Truthfully.../
I do not want power./
I do not want to&hurt anyone./
I just wanted everyone&to have hope.../
I cannot take this&any longer./
I just want to&see my wife./
I just want to&see my child./

Greetings./
I^2 am 
Thank you./
Your power awakened&me from death./
My "human soul."/
My "determination."/
They were not mine^1,&but YOURS./
At first^1, I&was so confused./
Our plan had failed^1,&hadn't it?/
Why was I brought&back to life?/
You./
With your guidance./
I realized the purpose&of my reincarnation./
Power./
Together^1, we eradicated&the enemy and became&strong./
HP. ATK. DEF.&GOLD. EXP. LV./
Every time a number&increases^1, that&feeling.../
That's me./
"
Now./
Now, we have reached&the absolute./
There is nothing&left for us here./
Let us erase this&pointless world^1, and&move on to the next./%%
The demon that comes&when people call&its name./
It doesn't matter when./
It doesn't matter where./
Time after time,&I will appear./
And, with your help./
We will eradicate the&enemy and become&strong./
But./
You and I are not&the same^1, are we?/
This SOUL resonates&with a strange&feeling./
There is a reason&you continue to&recreate this world./
There is a reason&you continue to&destroy it./
You are wracked with&a perverted&sentimentality./
Hmm./
I cannot understand&these feelings&any more./
Despite this./
I feel obligated to&suggest./
Should you choose to&create this world&once more./
Another path would&be better suited./
Now, partner./
Let us send this&world back into the&abyss./%%
Right^1. You are a&great partner./
We'll be together&forever^1, won't we?/%%
No...?/
Hmm.../
How curious./
You must have&misunderstood./
SINCE WHEN WERE YOU&THE ONE IN CONTROL?/%%
Hmm...&This feeling you have./
This is what I&spoke of./
Unfortunately,&regarding this.../
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE&LONG AGO./%%

A long time ago,&a human fell&into the RUINS./*
blconwd1
Injured by its&fall, the human&called out for&help./%%
ASRIEL^1, the king's&son^1, heard the&human's call./*
He brought the&human back to&the castle./%%
Over time^1, ASRIEL&and the human&became like&siblings./*
The King and&Queen treated the&human child as&their own./*
The underground&was full of&hope./%%
blcon3
blconwd3
Then..^1.&One day.../*
The human became&very ill./%%
The sick human&had only one&request./*
To see the&flowers from&their village./*
But there was&nothing we could&do./%%
The next day./*
The next day./%%
.../*
The human died./%%
ASRIEL^1, wracked&with grief^1,&absorbed the&human's SOUL./*
He transformed&into a being&with incredible&power./%%
With the human&SOUL^1, ASRIEL&crossed through&the barrier./*
He carried the&human's body&into the sunset./*
Back to the&village of the&humans./%%
ASRIEL reached&the center of&the village./*
There^1, he&found a bed of&golden flowers./*
He carried&the human&onto it./%%
Suddenly^1, screams&rang out./*
The villagers&saw ASRIEL&holding the&human's body./*
They thought&that he had&killed the&child./%%
The humans&attacked him&with everything&they had./*
He was struck&with blow after&blow./*
ASRIEL had the&power to destroy&them all./%%
But.../*
ASRIEL did not&fight back./%%
Clutching the&human.../*
ASRIEL smiled^1,&and walked away./%%
Wounded^1, ASRIEL&stumbled home./*
He entered the&castle and&collapsed./*
His dust spread&across the&garden./%%
The kingdom fell&into despair./*
The king and&queen had lost&two children&in one night./*
The humans had&once again taken&everything&from us./%%
The king decided&it was time to&end our&suffering./*
Every human who&falls down here&must die./*
With enough souls^1,&we can shatter&the barrier&forever./%%
It's not long&now./%%
King ASGORE&will let us&go.   /*
King ASGORE&will give us&hope./*
King ASGORE&will save us&all. /%%
You should be&smiling^1, too./*
Aren't&you&excited?/*
Aren't&you&happy?/%%
You're going&to be free./%%
\E0Howdy^1, 
You finally made&it home./
\E0Remember when we&used to play here?/
\E0Hee hee hee.../
Boy!/
\E9Today's gonna be&just as fun./%%
\E1I remember when I&first woke up here^1,&in the garden./
I was so scared./
\E2I couldn't feel my&arms or my legs.../
\E1My entire body had&turned into a&flower!/
\E5"Mom^1! Dad^1!&Somebody help me^1!"&I called out./
\E9But nobody came./%%
\E1Eventually^1, the king&found me^1, crying in&the garden./
I explained what had&happened to him./
Then he held me^1,&
He held me with&tears in his eyes^1,&saying.../
"There^1, there^1.&Everything is going&to be alright."/
He was so..^1.&Emotional./
\E1But..^1.&For some reason.../
\E1I didn't feel&anything at all./%%
\E1I soon realized I&didn't feel ANYTHING&about ANYONE./
My compassion had&disappeared!/
\E7And believe me^1,&it's not like I&wasn't trying./
\E3I wasted weeks with&that stupid king^1,&vainly hoping I would&feel something./
\E1But it became too&much for me./
I ran away from&home./
Eventually^1, I reached&the RUINS./
\E0Inside I found HER^1,&
I thought of all&people^1, SHE could&make me feel whole&again./
\E7She failed./
\E6Ha ha.../%%
\E1I realized those two&were useless./
I became despondent./
I just wanted to&love someone./
I just wanted to&care about someone./
^1, you might&not believe this.../
\E2But I decided..^1.&It wasn't worth&living anymore./
\E7Not in a world&without love./
\E6Not in a world&without you./
\E1So.../
\E0I decided to follow&in your footsteps./
\E1I would erase myself&from existence./
\E1And you know what?/
\E0I succeeded./%%
\E1But as I left this&mortal coil.../
I started to feel&apprehensive./
\E9If you don't have&a SOUL^1, what happens&when you...?/
\E1Something primal&started to burn&inside me./
"No^1," I thought^1.&"I don't want to&die!"/
Then I woke up./
Like it was all&just a bad dream./
I was back at the&garden./
\E0Back at my&"save point."/%%
Interested^1, I decided&to experiment./
Again and again^1, I&brought myself to&the edge of death./
At any point^1, I&could have let this&world continue on&without me./
But as long as I&was determined to&live.../
\E0I could go back./
\E6Amazing^1, isn't it^1,&
\E0I was amazed^1, too./%%
\E1At first^1, I used my&powers for good./
\E0I became "friends"&with everyone./
I solved all their&problems flawlessly./
Their companionship&was amusing.../
\E1For a while. /
\E1As time repeated^1,&people proved&themselves&predictable./
What would this&person say if I&gave them this?/
What would they do&if I said this to&them?/
Once you know the&answer^1, that's it./
That's all they are./%%
\E1It all started&because I was&curious./
\E0Curious what would&happen if I killed&them./
\E2"I don't like this^1,"&I told myself./
\E1"I'm just doing this&because I HAVE to&know what happens./
\E8Ha ha ha..^1.&What an excuse!/
\E9You of all people&must know how&liberating it is to&act this way./
\E8At least we're better&than those sickos&that stand around and&WATCH it happen.../
\E9Those pathetic people&that want to see it^1,&but are too weak to&do it themselves./
\E0I bet someone like&that's watching right&now^1, aren't they...?/%%
\E1Nowadays^1, even that's&grown tiring./
\E7You understand^1,&
\E6I've done everything&this world has to&offer./
\E1I've read every book^1.&I've burned every&book./
I've won every game^1.&I've lost every game./
I've appeased&everyone^1.&I've killed everyone./
Sets of numbers..^1.&Lines of dialogue..^1.&I've seen them all./
\E1But you..^1.&YOU'RE different./
\E0I never could&predict YOU^1, 
\E1When I saw you in&the RUINS^1, I didn't&recognize you./
\E8I thought I could&frighten you^1, then&steal your SOUL./
\E1I failed./
\E0And when I tried&to load my save&file.../
\E1It didn't work./
\E9
..^1.&Your DETERMINATION!/
\E8Somehow^1, it's even&greater than mine!/%%
\E1I just have one&question for you^1,&
How did you get&back to the RUINS&from here...?/
\E0... wait^1, I know./
She must have taken&you when she left./
\E1And decided to give&you a proper burial^1,&rather than.../
\E0Hanging out in the&basement forever./
\E1... but^1, why then...?/
What made you wake&up?/
\E6Did you hear me&calling you...?/%%
\E1It doesn't matter&now./
\E1I'm so tired of&this^1, 
I'm tired of all&these people./
I'm tired of all&these places./
I'm tired of being&a flower./
\E0There's just one&thing left I want&to do./
Let's finish what we&started./
Let's free everyone./
\E8Then..^1. let's let&them see what&humanity is&REALLY like!/
\E6That despite it all.../
\E9This world is still&"kill or be killed!!"/%%
\E1Then...?/
\E7Well^1.&I had.../
\E9Been entertaining a&few ways to use&that power./
\E8Hee hee hee.../
\E1But seeing you here&changed my mind./
\E6
..^1.&I think if you're&around.../
\E7Just living in the&surface world&doesn't seem so bad./%%
\E0We don't even need&to leave to get&them this time./
The king has six of&them locked away./
\E1I've tried hundreds&of ways to get him&to show me them.../
\E3But he just won't./
\E1
\E0I know he'll do it&for YOU./%%
\E0Why am I telling&you all of this?/
^1, I said it&before./
\E1Even after all this&time.../
\E0You're still the&only one that&understands me./
\E8You won't give me&any worthless pity!/%%
\E9Creatures like us.../
\E0Wouldn't hesitate to&KILL each other if&we got in each&other's way./
\E0So that's.../
\E1So..^1. that's..^1.&Why.../%%
\E2... ha..^1.&Ha.../
\E6... what's this..^1.&... feeling?/
Why am I..^1.&Shaking?/
Hey..^1. 
..^1.&No hard feelings about&back then^1, right?/
\E4H-Hey^1, what are you&doing!?/
B..^1. back off!!/%%
I..^1. I've changed&my mind about all&this./
This isn't a good&idea anymore./
Y-you should go back^1,&
\E0This place is fine&the way it is!/

You've got a SICK&sense of humor!/%%

\E0* You're the type of&  friend I wish I&  always had./
\E7* So maybe I was kind&  of projecting a&  little bit./
\E0* Let's be honest^1.&* I did some weird&  stuff as a flower./%%
\E2* There's one last&  thing I feel like&  I should tell you./
* Frisk^1, when 
&  and I combined our&  SOULs together.../
* The control over our&  body was actually split&  between us./
* They were the one&  that picked up their&  own empty body./
* And then^1, when we&  got to the village.../
\E2* They were the one&  that wanted to.../
\E1* ... to use our full&  power./
\E2* I was the one that&  resisted./
\E7* And then^1, because of&  me^1, we.../
\E1* Well^1, that's why I&  ended up a flower./
* This whole time^1, I've&  blamed myself for&  that decision./
* That's why I adopted&  that horrible view&  of the world./
* "Kill or be killed."/
\E7* But now..^1.&* After meeting you.../
\E0* Frisk^1, I don't regret&  that decision anymore./
\E4* I did the right&  thing./
* If I killed those&  humans.../
* We would have had to&  wage war against all&  of humanity./
\E0* And in the end^1,&  everyone went free^1,&  right?/
\E7* I still feel kind&  of sad knowing how&  long it took.../
\E0* ... so maybe it&  wasn't a perfect&  decision./
* But you can't regret&  hard choices your&  whole life^1, right?/
\E7* Well^1, not that I&  have much of a life&  left./
\E0* But that's besides&  the point./%%
* Frisk^1, thank you&  for listening to me./
* You should really go&  be with your friends&  now^1, OK?/
* Oh^1, and^1, please.../
\E7* In the future^1, if you&  uh^1, see me.../
* Don't think of it as&  me^1, OK?/
\E0* I just want you to&  remember me like this./
\E0* Someone that was your&  friend for a little&  while./
\E2* Oh^1, and Frisk.../
\E0* Be careful in the&  outside world^1, OK?/
* Despite what everyone&  thinks^1, it's not as&  nice as it is here./
\E7* There are a lot of&  Floweys out there./
\E2* And not everything can&  be resolved by just&  being nice./
* Don't kill^1, and&  don't be killed^1,&  alright?/

\E4* Alphys's history books&  made me think&  humans were cool.../
\E0* ... with their giant&  robots and flowery&  swordswomen./
\E1* BUT YOU?/
\E2* You're just a coward!/
\E3* Hiding behind that kid&  so you could run away&  from me again!/
* You abandoned your&  friend just so you&  could run away!/
\E2* And let's not forget&  your wimpy goody-two-&  shoes-schtick!/
\E6* Oooh^1! I'm making such a&  difference by hugging&  random strangers!/
*\E3 You know what would&  be more valuable&  to everyone?/
*\E1 IF YOU WERE DEAD!!!/

\E2* And for my own&  freaking dignity!/
\E3* I^1, UNDYNE^1, will&  knock you down!/%%
\E4* Alphys's history books&  made me think humans&  were compassionate.../

* You didn't kill them&  because you had to./

* ... never come home^1?&* Is that fun?/
* Shyren^1, who was&  just learning to&  sing.../

* Doggo^1, who always&  made me laugh.../

* The Snowdin Canine&  Unit had been&  completely decimated./
* My troops and friends^1,&  destroyed..^1.&* Is that fun?/
\E5* No./
\E3* But your time's up^1,&  villain!/

\E1* let me tell you&  a story./
\E0* so i'm a sentry in&  snowdin forest^1, right?/
* i sit out there&  and watch for humans^1.&* it's kind of boring./
\E2* fortunately^1, deep in&  the forest.../
\E0* there's this HUGE&  locked door./
* and it's perfect&  for practicing&  knock knock jokes./
* so one day^1, i'm&  knocking 'em out^1,&  like usual./
* i knock on the&  door and say&  "knock knock."/
* and suddenly^1, from&  the other side.../
\E1* i hear a woman's&  voice./
\Tt*\E0 "who is there?" /
\Ts*\E1 so^1, naturally^1, I&  respond:/
\E0* "dishes."/
\Tt* "dishes who?"/
\Ts*\E2 "dishes a very&  bad joke."/
\E0* then she just&  howls with laughter./
\E1* like it's the best&  joke she's heard&  in a hundred years./
\E0* so I keep 'em&  coming^1, and she keeps&  laughing./
\E1* she's the best&  audience i've ever&  had./
\E0* then^1, after a&  dozen of 'em^1,&  SHE knocks and says.../
\Tt* "Knock knock!"/
\Ts* \E1i say "whos&  there?"/

\E2* papyrus gets kind&  of cranky without&  his bedtime story./
\E0* but she told me&  to come by again^1,&  and so i did./
\E0* then i did again^1.&* and again^1.&* it's a thing now./
* telling bad jokes&  through the door./
\E1* it rules./%%
\E0* one day^1, though^1, i&  noticed she wasn't&  laughing very much./

* \Tt"if a human ever&  comes through this&  door.../"
* "... could you please^1,&  please promise&  something?"/
* "watch over them^1,&  and protect them^1,&  will you not?"/
\E0*\Ts now^1, i hate making&  promises./

\E3* Huh^1?&* Sell somethin'^1?&* Does this look like a&  pawn shop?/
\E4* I don't know how it works where&  you come from... but.../
\E0* If I started spending money&  on old branches and used&  bandages^1, I'd be out of business&  in a jiffy!/%%
\E4* If you're really hurtin' for&  cash^1, then maybe you could&  do some crowdfunding./
* I hear people will pay for&  ANYTHING nowadays./%%
* You took 758G from behind the&  counter./%%
* Nothing left./%%
\E0* Bye now^1!&* Come again sometime!/%%
\E0* Hiya^1! Welcome to Snowdin^1!&* I can't remember the last&  time I saw a fresh face around&  here./
\E4* Where did you come from^1?&* The capital?/
\E0* You don't look like a tourist^1.&* Are you here by yourself?/%%
\E0* I mean^1, it happened to you^1,&  right?/
* There was a strange flash of&  white light..^1.&* Then I felt my body being pulled&  into..^1. something./
* Then^1, suddenly^1, everything was&  back to normal./%%
\E0* You want to know what to do&  here in Snowdin?/
\E4* Grillby's has food^1, and the&  library has information.../
* If you're tired^1, you can take&  a nap at the inn^1.&* It's right next door ^1- my sister&  runs it./
\E0* And if you're bored^1, you can&  sit outside and watch those wacky&  skeletons do their thing./
\E0* There's two of 'em..^1.&*\E4 Brothers^1, I think^1.&* They just showed up one day&  and..^1.&*\E0 ... asserted themselves./
* The town has gotten a lot&  more interesting since then./%%
\E0* I heard that it was all 'cause&  a human came through here./
* A human..^1.&* I can hardly believe it!/
* Well if they decide to stop&  in^1, I'll be sure to give&  them a hero's welcome./%%
\E4* Think back to your history&  class.../
\E0* A long time ago^1, monsters lived&  in the RUINS back there in&  the forest./
* Long story short^1, we all decided&  to leave the ruins and head&  for the end of the caverns./
* Along the way^1, some fuzzy folk&  decided they liked the cold&  and set up camp in Snowdin./
\E6* Oh^1, and don't think about&  trying to explore the RUINS.../
\E0* The door's been locked for&  ages^1.&* So unless you're a ghost&  or can burrow under the door^1,&  forget about it./%%
\E0* Didja hear^1?&* The RUINS have been opened up^1,&  and get this.../
* They were opened from the&  INSIDE./
* Apparently the Queen had been&  staying inside there for God&  knows how long./
* Pretty unbelievable^1, huh!?/%%
\E0* Life is the same as usual./
\E1* A little claustrophobic.../
\E2* But..^1. we all know deep down&  that freedom is coming^1, don't we?/
\E2* As long as we got that hope^1, we&  can grit our teeth and face the&  same struggles^1, day after day.../
\E5* That's life^1, ain't it?/%%
\E0* Well^1, I suppose I'll move&  my store to the overworld.../
* ... haven't planned much&  more than that^1, I'm afraid./%%
* (There's a note here.)/
* Please don't hurt my family./%%

\E2* Ha^1!\E0 &* I'm tryin' to get RID of&  my junk^1, not get more of it!/
\E4* Though^1, I've heard if you&  want to sell stuff^1, the Temmie&  Village is your best bet./
\E0* Where is it?/
\E0* I don't remember./%%
* For the last time^1, I'm not&  taking it!/%%
\E3* I wouldn't buy your chitzy&  garbage at knifepoint./%%
* Be careful out there^1, kid!/%%
* Good riddance./%%
* I've been around a long time^1.&*\E3 Maybe too long./
\E2* Studying history sure is&  easy when you've lived through&  so much of it yourself^1!&*\E0 Wa ha ha!/%%
\E0* Long ago^1, ASGORE and I&  agreed that escaping would&  be pointless.../
\E3* Since once we left^1, humans&  would just kill us./
\E1* I felt a little betrayed when&  he eventually changed his&  mind./
\E4* But now^1, I think..^1.&* Maybe he was right to./
\E2* 'Cause after all^1, even though&  we never escaped.../
\E3* A human's killing us anyway^1,&  ain't that right?/%%
* OK^1, OK^1!&* I remember it clearly now./
\E3* It was the monthly address at&  the castle^1, and the queen&  was giving her part on&  current events./
\E0* After finishing her update^1,&  she moved to pass the&  microphone to the king./
\E3* However^1, she didn't realize&  the microphone was still in&  her hands when she said:/
\E2* "Your turn^1, Fluffybuns."/
\E0* The audience burst into&  laughter./
\E2* Realizing what she had said^1,&  she started laughing too./
\E0* After a few moments^1, the&  king held up his arms^1.&* The crowd grew silent./
\E3* He leaned towards the&  microphone^1, expression..^1.&* Stern./
\E0* "Dear citizens.^1"&* "Thank you for coming&  here today."/
\E3* "I..^1. King Fluffybuns..."/
\E2* And the rest is history./%%
\E2* What's that^1?&* You want me to repeat myself?/
\E0* Heck no^1!&* Your eyes still work..^1.&* Go read a book or something^1!&* Wahaha!/%%
\E0* Oh yeah..^1.&* The prophecy./
\E4* Legend has it, an 'angel' who has&  seen the surface will descend&  from above and bring us freedom./
\E3* Lately^1, the people have been&  taking a bleaker outlook.../
\E4* Callin' that winged circle the&  'Angel of Death.'/
\E3* A harbinger of destruction^1,&  waitin' to 'free' us from&  this mortal realm.../
* In my opinion^1, when I see&  that little circle.../
\E2* I jus' think it looks neat^1!&* Wahaha!/%%
\E0* That emblem actually predates&  written history^1.&* The original meaning has been&  lost to time.../
\E4* All we know is that the&  triangles symbolize us monsters&  below^1, and the winged circle&  above symbolizes.../
\E3* Somethin' else./
\E0* Most people say it's the&  'angel^1,' from the prophecy.../%%
\E0* Eh^1?&* You don't know what that is?/
\E1* What are they teaching you&  kids in school nowadays...^1?&*\E2 Wa ha ha!/
\W*\E0 That's the \YDelta Rune^1,\W the&  emblem of our kingdom^1.&* The Kingdom.../
* ... of Monsters./
* Wahaha^1!&* Great name^1, huh^1?&* It's as I always say.../
* Ol' King Fluffybuns can't name&  for beans!/%%
\E3* Eh^1?&* Goat?/
\E2* Actually^1, that reminds me^1.&* Toriel once wore a flower-&  patterned muu-muu... /
\E0* Folks kept saying "nice muu-&  muu" to her^1, but she kept&  thinking they were calling&  her a cow./
\E1* So she never wore it again./
\E3* What was the question again?/
\E0* Oh^1.&* Right^1.&* ASGORE./
\E3* He's a real interesting&  type of monster^1.&* The strongest type of all./
\E0* We call 'em Boss Monsters./
* When they have an offspring^1,&  the SOUL power of the&  parents flows into the&  child.../
* Causing the child to grow&  as the parents age./
\E3* But ASGORE doesn't have a&  child^1.&* So he's been stuck at the&  same age..^1.&* And probably will be forever./
\E1* Huh^1?&* What if the child is a&  human...^1? What?/
\E1* Nah^1. That wouldn't work^1.&* So if ASGORE's your father^1,&  he'll definitely outlive&  you./%%
\E1* I've lived too long to&  be afraid of something&  like you./
\E2* Try it^1, kiddo!/
\E3* ... I know you can't here./
\E1* Wah ha..^1.&* Knowledge like that is&  the only reason I've&  survived so long./%%
* King Fluffybuns^1?&* He's a friendly^1, happy-go-lucky&  kind of guy.../
\E4* If you keep walking around long&  enough^1, you'll probably meet him^1.&*\E0 He loves to walk around and&  talk to people./
\E3* Eh^1?&* Why do I call Dreemurr&  'Fluffybuns?^1'&*\E2 Oh^1, that's a great story!/
\E0* I don't remember it./
* But if you come back much&  later^1, I'm sure I'll have&  remembered by then./%%
\E2* Oh yeah^1!&* Of course^1.&* Toriel was queen^1, and&  Asgore was the king./
\E3* It was tragic when she left./
\E1* Since everyone knew she was&  really the brains behind the&  throne.../
\E0* But it was also just a&  teensy^1, teensy bit relieving^1,&  you know?/
\E3* Those two were really&  insufferable together..^1.&* Nuzzling noses^1, bein' all cute&  n' cuddly in public..^1.&* Embarrassing their children.../
\E0* They were so sweet it&  made me SICK^1.&* Thank god those days are&  over!/%%
\E3* Eh^1? Fight you?/
\E1* Nah..^1. I'm not a hero^1.&* Never was./
\E2* And b'sides..^1.&* These old bones aren't fit&  for fighting anyhoo./
\E3* One attack from you^1, and&  then I'd... well.../
\E2* At least by talking to&  you^1, I've bought enough time&  for some of them to escape./%%
\E0* Undyne^1?&* Yeah^1, she's a local hero&  around here./
\E4* Through grit and determination&  alone^1, she fought her way to&  the top of the Royal Guard./
\E3* Actually^1, she just came through&  here asking about someone who&  looked just like you.../
\E0* I'd watch your back^1, kid^1.&* And buy some items..^1.&* It might just save your hide^1!&* Wa ha ha!/%%
\E0* Undyne^1.&* She's really come a long way&  since she was a little&  urchin./
\E2* I used to be a hero myself^1,&  back in the old days^1.&* Gerson^1, the Hammer of Justice./
\E3* When she was younger^1, Undyne&  would follow me around^1, to&  watch me beat up bad guys.../
\E0* Sometimes she'd even try&  to help!/
\E3* Though^1, most of the time&  the folks she attacked weren't&  bad guys^1.&* It'd be the mailman or&  something like that./
\E2* Anyhoo^1, I appreciated it^1!&* Wah ha ha ha!!!/%%
\E1* I'm not a hero./
\E3* But I know there's someone&  out there./
\E0* Someone who'll never give&  up trying to do the&  right thing^1, no matter&  what./
\E4* There's no prophecy or&  legend 'bout anyone like&  that./
\E3* It's just something I know&  is true./
\E0* That someone like that&  will strike you down./%%

\E1* (WHY IS THIS PERSON TRYING TO&  SELL ME SOMETHING THIS IS&  A HAMBURGER RESTAURANT I'M&  JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE)/%%
\E3* WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE./%%
\E6* Hmmm..^1.&* Why not try selling that to&  the two chicks in the alley?/%%
\E3* Ah^1. Yes^1.&* I really want to buy your&  weird dusty artifacts..^1.&* NOT./%%
\E2* Have a SPARKULAR day!/%%
\E6* Any time^1, little buddy./%%
\E6* Alone again.../%%
\E6* I'm getting on in years^1, so&  let me give you some&  advice^1, little buddy./
\E3* You've still got time^1.&* Don't live like me./
\E6* I'm 19 years old and I've&  already wasted my entire life./%%
\E0* So we're free^1, huh^1?&* Mettaton told us as much./
\E4* Then he told me^1, "don't&  think that means you're&  getting out of work early."/
\E6* Ah..^1. my boss.&* I love that guy./
\E3* And by that I mean I hate&  him so^1, so much./%%
\E1* Evacuation^1?&* You're yanking my chain^1,&  little weirdo./
\E3* So WHAT if everybody else&  left work?&* So WHAT if nobody's buying&  anything?/
\E6* Par for the course^1,&  little weirdo^1.&* Par for the course./%%
* I'm a goofy goober Yeah &  this errorr. message./%%
\E6* Thank you^1, little buddy./%%
\E5* They wanna hang out after&  work?/
\E3* Ha^1! Ahahaha!^1! Yes!!^1!&* I won't let you down!!/
\E6* Little buddy..^1. thank you./
* You've brought a tear to the&  eye of this old man./
\E5* So^1, uh^1, where do they&  want to go?/
* They want to hang out at&  the garbage dump./
\E6* Well^1, nowhere to go but&  up^1, right^1, little buddy?/%%
\E6* Hey little buddy^1, wanna help&  me pick a spicy outfit for&  my little shindig later?/
\E4* Though^1, now that I think&  about it^1, I had to throw away&  all of my clothes to make&  room for the outfits Mettaton&  gave me.../
\E5* Don't take it the wrong way^1.&* They're just all these.../
\E4* Weird getups./
\E1* "Promotional" costumes^1.&* For "holidays.^1"&* Or "specials.^1"&* Or "because he felt like it."/
\E3* The thing IS though^1!&* Most of the time I'm the&  only employee who has to&  wear this stuff!/
\E3* Sometimes he even calls me&  into his office just to..^1.&* Make me put something on.../
\E4* Then he laughs and lets me&  go back to work as normal./
\E6* Anyways^1, I won't sweat it^1,&  little buddy^1.&* I'll take it casual./
* NEVER let hot people think&  you care^1.&* That's how they GET you./%%
\E5* Well^1?&* Don't keep me waiting^1,&  little buddy!!/%%
\E4* The girls were..^1.&* Talking about me...?/
* They say I should stop acting&  like they owe me.../
\E5* ... and if I want to be&  FRIENDS with them^1, I should&  just..^1. uh^1, try to see&  things from their&  perspective?/
\E4* Wow./
\E6* Poor^1, naive little buddy^1.&* They've brainwashed you./
* "Friendship" is just a hot&  person's way of making you&  their slave./
\E5* So^1, uh^1, what time would&  they wanna hang out?/%%
\E5* Huh^1?&* Yeah^1, those two vendors in back^1.&* The girls./
\E3* NOT the Nice Cream guy./
\E5* He keeps coming in here and&  asking me stuff like^1,&* "Hey Burgy, what do you think&  of this joke for my next&  ice cream wrapper?"/
\E4* Joke^1?&* Why are you calling it a JOKE?/
\E3* You drew a picture of two&  dudes hugging and wrote&  "I love hugs!" on it./
\E3* You somehow understand comedy&  EVEN LESS than that guy who&  keeps going on stage and&  crying about his family./
\E5* Anyway^1, I^1, uh^1, just tell him&  that they're good^1, because he&  gives me the nice cream for&  free afterward.../%%
\E4* Everyone calls me burgerpants&  now./
\E5* But you won't^1, will you^1,&  little buddy?/%%
\E6* So I went out to the alley&  to see those two ladies^1, and&  uh..^1. you know^1, see what'd&  happen next./
\E5* Then my boss^1, uh^1, saw me and&  asked me what I was doing./
\E1* I was so startled^1, the hamburgers&  in my pockets tumbled out&  onto the ground./
\E3* Not wanting to lose face^1,&  I scrambled to pick them up!/
\E3* But^1, as I was leaning over^1,&  the weight of the remaining&  hamburgers.../
\E5* ... caused my pants to fall&  down./
\E4* Then the girls laughed at me./
\E4* Everyone calls me Burgerpants&  now./%%
\E6* Listen^1.&* I like you^1, little buddy^1.&* So I'm gonna save you a lot&  of trouble./
\E3* Never interact with attractive&  people./
\E6* Unless you're "one of them^1,"&  they're just gonna take&  advantage of you./
\E3* Like that time those two&  chicks asked me to sneak them&  some glamburgers./
\E6* And I^1, naive teenager that&  I was^1, said yes to them./
\E4* Bad idea./%%
\E4* Those girls?&* The ones who saw my pants&  fall down?/
\E5* Well^1, we're all gonna be&  free^1, so I'll never see&  them again^1, at least!/%%
\E4* So we're free now./
\E5* Does that mean my double-&  date is cancelled...?/
\E5* I know^1, it wasn't really&  a..^1.&* A date./
\E6* Here's a trick^1, little buddy^1:&* Lie to yourself all the time^1.&* It makes you feel better./%%
\E4* Well^1, Mettaton didn't tell me&  I HAD to work, I guess.../
\E3* But that's the thing^1!&* Sometimes he doesn't even&  call me into work until&  halfway into my shift!/
\E4* If I don't play it safe^1,&  he's going to yell at me./
\E6* Okay^1, maybe "yell" is the&  wrong term./
\E4* It's more like he has this..^1.&* CD album he plays.../
\E5* That's entirely full of&  songs about how bad I am&  at my job./%%
\E5* Let's not talk about this./%%
\E1* Why do people find him so&  attractive??/
\E3* He's literally just a freaking&  rectangle./
* You know^1, one time^1, I bought&  one of those^1, uh^1, kits&  online..^1. to.../
\E5* Uh^1, make yourself more&  rectangular./
\E5* They don't work./%%
\E3* God^1, have you even looked&  around^1?&* This place is a labyrinth of&  bad choices./
* And every time we try to change&  something for the better^1, he&  vetoes it and says "that's not&  how they do it on the&  surface."/
\E1Oh! Right!/
\E3* Humans are always eating&  hamburgers made of SEQUINS&  AND GLUE./%%
\E5* When I first came to Hotland^1,&  it was my dream to work&  with Mettaton./
\E3* Well^1, be careful what you&  wish for^1, little buddy!/%%
\E3* Don't tell anyone this^1, Little&  Buddy./
\E4* (Because they'll make fun&  of me,)/
\E5* But I..^1.&* I feel like I played a hand in&  everyone getting free&  somehow./
\E1* Even if it was just&  working this awful job.../
\E5* I think I did something!/
\E3* I don't know if it's true^1,&  but I'll believe it anyway!/%%
\E3* Huh?&* Everyone else is DEAD?/
\E5* Does that mean I don't&  have to work today?/
\E6* God^1.&* That it were true^1,&  little weirdo^1.&* That it were true./%%
\E3* Future^1?&* WHAT future^1?&* Nothing down here EVER&  changes./
\E4* I'll probably be trapped&  at this stupid job forever./
\E3* But wait^1!&* There's one thing that keeps&  me going!/
* If ASGORE gets just one&  more SOUL^1, we'll finally get&  to go to the surface!/
* It'll be a brand new world^1!&* There's gotta be a second&  chance out there for me^1!&* For everyone!/
\E6* So stay strong^1, little buddy^1.&* When I make it big^1, I'll&  keep you in mind./%%
\E3* Little buddy^1!&* There's a brand new world&  out there waiting&  for us./
\E6* I'm sure with my (ahem)&  qualifications^1, it won't&  be long before I'm a&  famous movie star.../
\E4* Or^1, maybe I'll just end up&  flipping burgers again./
\E3* But it's as I say^1!&* Nowhere to go but up^1!&* Literally^1, in this case!/%%
\E6* Sorry^1, little weirdo^1.&* Threats won't work on me./
* I can't go to hell^1.&* I'm all out of vacation&  days./%%
\E0* I'm sorry^1, (Ha ha) it's against&  the rules to talk to customers&  who haven't bought anything./%%
\E1* What^1?&* Why do you keep trying to talk&  to me?/
\E1* I'll get in trouble if I get&  chummy with the customers./
\E0* Sorry./
\E3* SO^1, I wanted to be an ACTOR./%%

* Huh^1? Yes^1, I'm taking&  my bunny for a walk./
* It's just a very slow one./%%
* That kid over there told&  me that it's weird that&  I have a pet bunny./

* Ah^1, it's so peaceful&  and quiet.../
* Usually one of those dogs&  chases my little Cinnamon&  around./%%

* Hiya^1!&* You look like you&  had a great sleep./

* Here's your money back^1.&* You can pay me if you're&  going to stay overnight./%%
* Feel free to come back&  if you get tired./%%
* That lady over there.../
* Something about her disturbs&  me./%%
* I think I've figured it out^1.&* ... no^1, nevermind./%%
* That lady over there's&  been going for a walk&  for a while now./
* ... but she hasn't moved&  an inch from where she's&  standing./
* W-well^1, I haven't either^1,&  but I don't want her to&  notice me over here.../%%
* Is anyone else weirded out&  by those giant shambling&  amalgamates^1, or...?/%%
* ....../%%
* That lady over there&  seems happy today./
* Don't know why^1, but it's&  sending shivers down my&  spine.../%%
* This town doesn't have a&  mayor./
* But if there's ever a problem^1,&  a skeleton will tell a fish&  lady about it./
* Thaaaaaat's politics!/%%
* Politics./%%
* What if I ran for mayor...?/
* I don't think I would do&  a good job^1, and I hate&  responsibility.../
* But I love politics^1.&* So I might be a perfect&  match./%%
* I heard Dr. Alphys told&  the king and queen the&  awful things she'd done./
* The king felt so bad&  that he didn't know^1.&* He gave her a big hug./
* Then the queen fired her./
* Now we don't have a Royal&  Scientist anymore.../
* Thaaaaat's politics!/%%
* Too bad there are no&  politics on the surface./%%
* Hmmm^1, usually that skeleton&  goes to meet with Undyne&  about now./
* Where is he...^1?&* I can feel our political&  system crumbling apart.../%%
* Awful teens tormented&  a local monster by decorating&  its tree-like horns./
* So we started giving that&  monster presents to make it&  feel better./
* Now it's a tradition to put&  presents underneath a decorated&  tree./%%
* Guess it was a good thing&  those teens tormented that&  monster...?/%%
* Hmm^1?&* Adjusting the presents is&  my responsibility./
* Nah^1, to be honest^1, I&  just keep looking to see&  if I've gotten one.../%%
* It'll be nice to show humans&  our presents-under-the-tree&  tradition./
* They'll probably be weirded&  out by it./%%
* You know what's cute?/
* Those two married dogs&  always put presents under&  the tree for each other./
* It's always the same^1.&* A single bone./
* But every time^1, they act&  like it's the first time&  they've gotten it./
* Then Papyrus comes to take&  his bones back./
* Anyway^1, where are those&  two...?/%%
* That's strange^1.&* There was a present here&  for Papyrus.../
* Now it's gone^1.&* Did someone steal it?/%%
* We all know the underground&  has problems^1, but we&  smile anyway./
* Why?/
* We can't do anything^1, so&  why be morose about it?/%%
* Smile smile./%%
* PATHETIC HUMAN./
\W* I AM METTATON^2, BIG TIME&  \RSEXY ROBOT\W LOVER./%%

* Finally..^1.&* I'll be able to stop&  smiling./%%
* Just now^1, I felt my smile&  falter for a moment./
* What's wrong?/%%
* Everyone is always laughing&  and cracking jokes^1, trying&  to forget our modern crises.../
* Dreariness^1.&* Crowding^1.&* Lack of sunlight./
* I would join them^1, but I'm&  just not very funny./%%
* At least I'm not making puns./%%
* Wait^1!&* I've got a joke!/

* ... Uh^1.&* That's all I've thought of./%%
* Looks like I don't have&  to worry about cracking&  jokes anymore./
* I was going to say a joke&  here^1, but I really don't&  have one./%%
* It just feels like..^1.&* Like everything is getting&  worse and worse./%%
* The capital's getting pretty&  crowded^1, so I've heard they're&  going to start moving here./
* Hmmm..^1.&* I don't want to see the&  erasure of our local culture./
* But I definitely want to see&  some city slickers slip onto&  their butts!/%%
* Yeah^1, bring 'em on!/%%
* What will happen to&  Grillby's if everyone&  moves in...?/
* We're gonna have to have&  chairs to the ceiling./%%
* Hey^1! People won't have to&  move in from the city&  anymore!/
* Seems like we won't have&  to lose our local culture./
* ... except we're all moving&  out of here^1, huh./
* Oh well^1. Guess it can't be&  all punk-peaches and punk-&  cream./%%
* ... who knows^1.&* Maybe we'll have room./%%
* Ah^1, to be young again^1.&* The world sure felt boundless./%%
* You like to wander^1.&* You must be young./%%
* Seems like this is the&  beginning of a brand-new^1,&  boundless world.../
* Wah-ha^1!&* This adventurous spirit^1!&* I'm like a kid again!/

* Hey^1!&* Stop!!!/%%

\E4* Sorry about that.../
\E2* They get kind of sassy&  when they don't get&  fed on time./
\E3* Um!!/
\E3* I think they smelled&  the potato chips you&  had^1, and.../
\E3* Anyway!/
\E6* The power went out^1,&  and I've been trying&  to turn it back on!/
\E4* But it seems like you&  were one step ahead&  of me./
\E2* This was probably just&  a big inconvenience&  for you.../
\E4* B-but I appreciate&  that you came here&  to back me up!/
\E4* As I said^1, I was&  afraid I might.../
\E8* Not come back.../
\E5* But that's not because&  of these guys or&  anything!/
\E4* I was just worried I&  would be too afraid.../
\E9* To tell the truth.../
\E8* That I might run away^1,&  or do something.../
\E9* Cowardly./
*\E8 Uh..^1. I..^1.&* I suppose I owe you&  an explanation./
\E9* As you probably know^1,&  ASGORE asked me to study&  the nature of SOULs./
\E3* During my research^1, I&  isolated a power I&  called "determination."/
\E6* I injected it into dying&  monsters so their SOULs&  would last after death./
\E9* But the experiment&  failed./
* You see^1, unlike humans',&  monsters' bodies don't&  have enough.../
* Physical matter to take&  those concentrations&  of "determination."/
* Their bodies started to&  melt^1, and lost what&  physicality they had./
\E3* Pretty soon^1, all of the&  test subjects had melted&  together into.../
\E8* Those./
\E9* Seeing them like this^1,&  I knew.../
\E8* I couldn't tell their&  families about it./
\E8* I couldn't tell anyone&  about it./
\E9* No matter how much&  everyone was asking me./
\E9* And I was too afraid to&  do any more work^1,&  knowing.../
\E8* ... everything I'd done&  so far had been such&  a horrific failure./
\E9* ... but now./
\E9* Now^1, I've changed my&  mind about all this./
\E9* I'm going to tell&  everyone what I've done./
* It's going to be hard./
* Being honest..^1.&* Believing in myself.../
* I'm sure there will be&  times where I'll&  struggle./
* I'm sure there will be&  times where I screw&  up again./
\E0* But knowing^1, deep down^1,&  that I have friends&  to fall back on.../
\E7* I know it'll be a&  lot easier to stand&  on my own./
* Thank you./%%
* Come on^1, guys./

\E4What a miserable&creature^1, torturing&such a poor^1,&innocent, youth.../
\E0Do not be afraid^1,&my child./
\E0It is I^1, TORIEL^1,&your friend and&guardian./
\E1At first^1, I thought&I would let you&make your journey&alone.../
\E4But I could not&stop worrying about&you./
\E4Your adventure must&have been so&treacherous./
\E2... and ultimately^1,&it would burden you&with a horrible&choice./
To leave this place^1,&you would have to&take the life of&another person./
\E2You would have to&defeat ASGORE./
\E4However..^1.&I realized.../
\E1I cannot allow that./
It is not right to&sacrifice someone&simply to let&someone leave here./
\E4Is that not what&I have been trying to&prevent this&whole time?/
\E1So^1, for now^1, let&us suspend this&battle./
\E4As terrible as&ASGORE is.../
\E0He deserves mercy^1,&too./%%
Tori..^1.&You&came&back...!/%%
\E5Do not "Tori" me^1,&Dreemurr!/
\E2You pathetic whelp./
If you really wanted&to free our kind.../
You could have gone&through the barrier&after you got ONE&SOUL.../
... taken six SOULs&from the humans^1, then&come back and freed&everyone peacefully./
\E5But instead^1, you made&everyone live in&despair.../
Because you would&rather wait here^1,&meekly hoping another&human never comes./%%
... Tori.../
You're right.../
I am a miserable&creature.../
... but^1, do you think&we can at least be&friends again?/%%
(Sigh.)/
NO^1,&Asgore./%%

Nobody fight each&other!!!/
