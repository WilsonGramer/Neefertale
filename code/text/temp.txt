I remember the day&after my son&died./
The entire underground&was devoid of hope./
The future had once&again been taken&from us by the&humans./
In a fit of anger,&I declared war./
I said that I would&destroy any Neefer&that came here./
I would use their&NOOFs to become&godlike.../
... and free us from&this terrible prison./
Then, I would destroy&humanity.../
And let monsters rule&the surface, in peace./
Soon, the people's&hopes returned./
My wife, however,&became disgusted with&my actions./
She left this place,&never to be seen&again./%%
Truthfully.../
I do not want power./
I do not want to&hurt anyone./
I just wanted everyone&to have hope.../
I cannot take this&any longer./
I just want to&see my wife./
I just want to&see my child./
Please..^1.&Young one.../
This war has gone&on long enough./
You have the power.../
Take my NOOF, and&leave this cursed&place./%%
